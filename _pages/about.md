NatDave is deeply committed to improving transportation systems with a focus on enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability.

Part of his work focuses on optimizing traffic signal control systems to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and minimize emissions, creating smarter and more responsive cities. By refining public transit systems through the implementation of strategies like smart transit signal priority, he strives to make them more reliable and efficient, thereby encouraging greater public adoption and reducing dependency on private vehicles.

Additionally, he has a particularly keen interest in promoting active transportation modes, such as cycling, to foster healthier communities and reduce environmental impacts. His expertise also extends to traffic demand modeling, where he analyzes and predicts traffic patterns to design infrastructure that meets the evolving needs of urban environments.

Driven by curiosity and with his strong statistics background, he is rigorously exploring the transformative potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in transportation. He vehemently believes that these technologies hold the key to developing cutting-edge mobility solutions like real-time traffic management systems that can respond dynamically to changing conditions.

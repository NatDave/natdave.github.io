NatDave is passionate about revolutionizing transportation systems by prioritizing safety, efficiency, and sustainability, shaping smarter, more connected cities.

## 🚦 Traffic Signal Optimization & Smart Transit Priority
NatDave specializes in optimizing traffic signal control to alleviate congestion and improve traffic flow. By implementing strategies like smart transit signal priority, he enhances the reliability and efficiency of public transit systems. These improvements encourage greater public transit use while reducing dependence on private vehicles, leading to lower emissions, less congestion, and a more sustainable, resilient urban transportation network.

## 🤖 AI & ML/DL in Transportation  
Leveraging his strong background in statistics, NatDave is actively exploring and researching on machine learning and artificial intelligence applications in transportation. He believes these technologies are crucial for developing advanced mobility solutions, including real-time traffic management systems.

## 🚴‍♂️ Active Transportation & Sustainability  
NatDave is deeply passionate about promoting active transportation modes like cycling to create healthier communities and reduce environmental impact. He has cycled thousands of miles across the USA and hundreds of miles in many other countries including Canada and the Netherlands.  

Each summer, he serves as a program assistant for a sustainable transportation study abroad program, accompanying Northeastern University students to the Netherlands. There, they explore integrated cycling infrastructure, efficient public transit networks, and strategic urban planning.

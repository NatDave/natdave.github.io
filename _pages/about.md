NatDave is dedicated to enhancing transportation systems by prioritizing safety, efficiency, and sustainability. He optimizes traffic signal control to alleviate congestion and improve traffic flow, contributing to smarter cities. By implementing strategies like smart transit signal priority, he improves the reliability and efficiency of public transit, encouraging its use and decreasing reliance on private vehicles.

NatDave is deeply passionate about promoting active transportation modes like cycling to create healthier communities and reduce environmental impacts. He's cycled thousands of miles in USA alone, and hundreds of miles in a few other countries including Canada and The Netherlands. Each summer, he serves as a program assistant for a sustainable transportation study abroad program, accompanying Northeastern University students to the Netherlands where they explore integrated cycling infrastructure, efficient public transit networks, and strategic urban planning.

Leveraging his strong background in statistics, NatDave is actively exploring the applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in transportation, believing these technologies are crucial for developing advanced mobility solutions like real-time traffic management systems.

title: "Impact of Electric Bikes on Trip Dynamics and System Efficiency"
permalink: /github/blue-bikes
excerpt: "The addition of electric bikes to Boston's Bluebikes system has likely changed trip dynamics, such as trip durations, demand patterns, and station usage. This analysis aims to explore how e-bikes have affected these factors, looking at differences in trip lengths, popular routes, and station turnover. By comparing e-bike trips with traditional bike trips, the goal is to understand how e-bikes have impacted overall system performance and user behavior. These insights will help inform strategies for improving bike distribution and optimizing the efficiency of the bike-sharing system.<br/><img src='/images/blue_bike.png'>"

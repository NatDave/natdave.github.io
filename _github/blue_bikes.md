title: "Regression-Based Trip Prediction Algorithm (in progress)"
permalink: /github/four-rooms
excerpt: "Some Bluebikes stations experience an influx of incoming bikes, leading to congestion, while others deplete quickly, resulting in a lack of available bikes; this analysis seeks to provide insights that optimize bike distribution and enhance operational efficiency for bike-sharing systems. The trip prediction algorithm aims to accurately estimate trip durations and destination stations by leveraging historical trip data.<br/><img src='/images/blue_bikes.png'>"

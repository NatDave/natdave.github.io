title: "TSP-Friendly Underlying Traffic Signal Control, An Essential Complement of Transit Signal Priority"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/tsp
excerpt: 'Transit Signal Priority (TSP) can reduce bus delays, but in the U.S., the reductions are often small due to TSP being applied within traffic signal systems not optimized for it. TSP-friendly signal control involves minimizing bus phase red times and adjusting green phases to match bus arrivals. Simulations in Boston showed that combining active TSP with TSP-friendly control reduced bus delay 2.0 to 3.1 times more than applying TSP over existing systems, with delays dropping to under 5 seconds at two sites.'

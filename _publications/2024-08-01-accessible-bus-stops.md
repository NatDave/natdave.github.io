category: reports
permalink: /publication/accessible-bus-stops
excerpt: 'Floating bus stops, adjacent to bike lanes, require bus passengers to cross the bike lane to board or alight, creating challenges, especially for visually impaired and wheelchair users. This study examined different floating bus stop designs in Greater Boston, analyzing rider behavior and conflicts with bicyclists, and provides design recommendations to improve accessibility and safety.'

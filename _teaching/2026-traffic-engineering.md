Evaluated assignments on intersection analysis and design including traffic flow theory and measurement, capacity analysis, queuing and delay for vehicles and pedestrians, and signal timing plan design. Assisted students in applying street design principles covering street functions, speed control, street and intersection layout, bicycling facilities (bike lanes and separated paths), and pedestrian facilities (sidewalks and crossings) to balance traffic capacity, safety, walkability, bikeability, and quality of public space.
